# Hi there 👋
### About Me 🤘
I am Faizaan, currently studying in a school somewhere in the UAE. I've recently begun coding and thus have a limited knowledge of the various languages, though I am comfortable coding in HTML5 (.html), CSS (.css), Python (.py) and JavaScript (.js). So far I've worked on 3 major projects with a team, and 5 solo projects.
- 🔬 I've participated in the AdventOfCode competition and am on my quest to resolve all the problems that it gives to me over the next couple of days.
- 🏫 I'm learning basic python as part of my high school syllabus.
- 📫 You can contact me on my email: faizaannasir06@gmail.com. 
- ⚡ Fun Fact: I like aeroplanes. 

### My Goals 🔭
- 📚 I would like to sepcialise in website and application development in my career as a software developer in the future. 
- 🤓 I would like to learn application development and python as well as some other modern programming languages. 
- 👑 I would like to lead a major project in the future.
