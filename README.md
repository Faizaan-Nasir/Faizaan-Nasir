# Hi there 👋
### About Me 🤘
I am Faizaan, a high-school graduate. I've recently begun coding and thus have a limited knowledge of the various languages, though I am comfortable coding in HTML5 (.html), CSS (.css), Python (.py) and JavaScript (.js). So far I've worked on 3 major projects with a team, and 5 solo projects.
- 🔬 I've participated in the AdventOfCode competition and am on my quest to resolve all the problems that it throws at me over the next couple of days.
- 📫 You can contact me on my email: faizaannasir06@gmail.com. 
- ⚡ Fun Fact: I am an aviation enthusiast.
